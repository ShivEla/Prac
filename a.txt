DISJOINT: The boundaries and interiors do not intersect.

TOUCH: The boundaries intersect but the interiors do not intersect.

OVERLAPBDYDISJOINT: The interior of one object intersects the boundary
and interior of the other object, but the two boundaries do not intersect. This
relationship occurs, for example, when a line originates outside a polygon and
ends inside that polygon.

OVERLAPBDYINTERSECT: The boundaries and interiors of the two objects
intersect.

EQUAL: The two objects have the same boundary and interior.

CONTAINS: The interior and boundary of one object is completely contained in the
interior of the other object.

COVERS: The boundary and interior of one object is completely contained in
the interior or the boundary of the other object, their interiors intersect, and
the boundary or the interior of one object and the boundary of the other object
intersect.

INSIDE: The opposite of CONTAINS. A INSIDE B implies B CONTAINS A.

COVEREDBY: The opposite of COVERS. A COVEREDBY B implies B COVERS A.

ON: The interior and boundary of one object is on the boundary of the other object.
This relationship occurs, for example, when a line is on the boundary of a polygon.

ANYINTERACT: The objects are non-disjoint.
